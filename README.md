Welcome to the Arkansascovid GitHub repo. 
Arkansascovid was created my Misty Orpin in March 2020 and was transferred to the University of Arkansas School of Journalism and Strategic Media in September 2020.

Please use our data and give us credit. Tell us what you like and what we can fix.

This is a work in progress and we welcome feedback. DM us at @ArkansasCovid on Twitter.
